            <p>Our mission has always been to make it easy for everyone to eat well and live well, and that means creating good fast food that as many people as possible can enjoy.

            All of our teams are trained that in the event of a guest mentioning they have an allergy, the guest should be directed to our Foodie Fact Sheet. This lists every ingredient in our dishes with the allergens marked in bold, and listed again in a separate column.
